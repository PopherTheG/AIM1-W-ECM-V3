/**
 * @brief       GUVC-T10GM-LA is a UV sensor module.
 * 
 * @note        UV sensors of Genicom make the photocurrent under UV light but
 *              the level of photocurrent is very low. This small signal is not easy
 *              to be checked by normal current measure equipments and it is not to
 *              fit input signal of analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
 * 
 * @note        Supply voltage: 
 *                  Min: 1.8V
 *                  Max: 5.5V
 *              Supply current:
 *                  Typ: 0.05mA
 *              Spectral detection range:
 *                  Min: 220nm
 *                  Max: 280nm
 *              Output voltage:
 *                  Min: 0V
 *                  Max: 5V
 *              Detection power range:
 *                  Min: 0 nW/cm^2      Remark: Vcc = 5V
 *                  Max: 20 nW/cm^2
 *              Response time:
 *                  Typ: 10ms
