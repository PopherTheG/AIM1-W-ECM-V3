PARTICULATE MATTER

What is PM? (source: https://www.aeroqual.com/particulate-matters-why-monitor-pm10-and-pm2-5)
Particulate air pollution is defined by the US EPA as an air-suspended mixture of both solid and
liquid particles. They are often separated into three classifications; coars, fine, and ultrafine
particles. Coarse particles have a diameter of 10um and 2.5um and settle relatively quickly whereas
fine (1 to 2.5um in diameter) and ultrafine (<1um in diameter) particles remain in suspension for
longer. Keep in mind that due to how the scale is built, PM10 (course) also automatically contains
PM2.5 (fine) and PM1.0 (ultrafine). Additionaly PM2.5 (fine) contains PM1.0 (ultrafine) as well. 
To put things into perspective, the human hair has a diameter of 50-70um and a grain of sand has a
diameter of 90um.

When someone talks about PM10 they are referring to particles smaller then 10um. These particles 
include dust, pollenn and mold spores. Conversely, when someone references PM2.5 they are referring
to particles smaller than 2.5um. These smaller particles include combustion particles, organic 
compounds and metals.

Where does PM come from? (source: https://www.aeroqual.com/particulate-matters-why-monitor-pm10-and-pm2-5)
Particulate matter can come from both human and natural sources. Natural sources include sea salt,
forest fires, pollen and mold. As they are natural occurences, they are harder to control and are
usually left unregulated. Human sources, however, can be regulated and understanding where PM comes
from is very important, PM10 is most associated with road dust and construction activities. Wear and
tear of brakes and tyres on vehicles and crushing activities at construction sites can all contribute
to a rise in PM10. Alternatively, PM2.5 is more associated with fuel burning, industrial combustion
processes and vehicle emissions.

Particle pollution and you health (source: https://www.cdc.gov/air/particulate_matter.html)
Breathing in particle pollution can be harmful to your health. Coarse (bigger) particles, called PM10,
can irritate you eyes, nose, and throat. Dust from roads, farms, dry riverbeds, construction sites, and
mines are types of PM10.

Fine (smaller) particles, called PM2.5, are more dangerous because they can get into the deep parts of 
your lungs - or even into your blood.
